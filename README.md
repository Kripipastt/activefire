## Using this repository

Each folder inside the `src/train` directory contains the CNNs approachs trained with different active fire detection algorithms. The code inside these folders are almost the same, the only existing changes are in the constants that configure the CNN (number of filters, number of channes, masks used, etc).

The masks used to train the model are obtained through some well-known active fire detection algorithms and the combination of them. The models inside `goli` folder were trained with the masks generated by [Kumar and Roy (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2017.1391341) conditions. The `murphy` folder use the [Murphy et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.02.027) conditions. And the `schroeder` folder use the [Schroeder  et  al.  (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.08.032) conditions. The `intersection` and `voting`folder use the masks generated by the combination of the three previous masks, while the first use the masks generated by the intersection of them (all masks must agree where fire occurs), the second use the masks generated by the agreement of at least two of them.

The folder named `unet_16f_2conv_762` (aka. U-Net-Light (3c)) means that the model used is a `U-net` starting with 16 convolutional filters, with 2 convolutions per block, using the channels 7, 6 and 2 from the source image. The folder named `unet_64f_2conv_762` (aka. U-Net (3c)) starts with 64 convolutional filters and use the channels 7, 6 and 2 from the source image. And the folder named `unet_64f_2conv_10c` (aka. U-Net (10c) ) is pretty much the same, starting with 64 convolutional filters in the first convolutional block and using the 10 channels.
